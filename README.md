# A-Global-view-of-Nutrition
As a Data Analyst from a Global health Organization, this project is to investigate the complex challenge of undernutrition and overnutrition across different countries, age groups, and genders. Used publicly available WHO data to uncover trends, patterns, and disparities in obesity and malnutrition rates around the world.
The goal is to derive meaningful insights that can inform global health strategies and help tackle the nutritional paradox of rising obesity and persistent malnutrition.
I have used the data from publicly available WHO data.
Implemented Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering techniques by renaming the column names into readable format, changed coutry codes into country name as per ISO Alpha-3 code, created new columns as age_group,CI_Width,obesity_level (for the obesity table only), malnutrition_level (for the malnutrition table only).
I have done Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Python and Identified missing values or unusual values andd replaced with the meaning full values. Analyzed trends across years, regions, or demographic groups by comparing obesity vs malnutrition distributions.
Also used visualization charts. 
Created SQL queries for 25 realtime data analysis and used Streamlit to show the output for Non-technical users to understand the analysis.
